In addition to the standard MIT license, this library requires the following:
The recorder itself only saves data on user's phone locally, thus it does not have any privacy problem.
However, if you are going to get the records out of the local storage (e.g. upload the records to your server),
please explicitly ask the user for permission, and promise to only use the records to debug your app.
This is a part of the license of this library.
